MeshHeart is a conditional generative model for 4D (3D+t) cardiac mesh sequences. By leveraging demographic and anthropometric factors (e.g., age, sex, height, weight), the model generates realistic and dynamic cardiac meshes conditioned on subject-specific attributes.

## Train

To train the MeshHeart model:

```bash
python main.py
```
